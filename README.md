## üß≠ Overview

This mini-project studies the performance of a **finite-capacity multi-service loss system** that supports both **voice and video calls**.  
The system is modeled using:
- The **Erlang-B formula** (for single-class traffic)
- A **Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC)** numerical model
- The **multi-Erlang product-form** analytical approach.

The objective is to determine the **maximum admissible voice arrival rate (Œª·µ•‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì)** such that the blocking probability for both services (voice and video) remains below **1%**.  
The project combines theoretical modeling, numerical computation, and visualization in MATLAB.
